  "summary": "Diff clearly updates the local content policy utility to no longer block on keywords, but the provided AiStudioPage diff is truncated, so it’s not possible to confirm that video generation no longer triggers the prohibited-content toast or that all related UI/copy was updated. Two modified meta/state files appear unrelated to the requested changes.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-49",
      "requirement": "Remove the keyword-based content policy block that prevents AI video generation when prompts contain adult/sexual terms (e.g., \"sex\"), so generation proceeds normally and no prohibited-content toast is shown.",
      "reason": "The diff shows contentPolicy utilities now always return false, but the AiStudioPage.tsx changes are truncated and do not show removal of any callsites (e.g., containsBlockedContent checks) or removal of the prohibited-content error toast in the video generation flow.",

      "requirement": "Update AI Studio user-facing content policy UI/copy so it no longer claims porn/explicit content prompts will be rejected/blocked by keyword detection (English only).",
      "reason": "No explicit UI/copy changes are visible in the provided truncated AiStudioPage.tsx snippet, and contentPolicy.ts only provides generic messages without showing where/if existing prohibitive wording in the Video Generation card was removed.",
