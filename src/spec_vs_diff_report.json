However, due to truncation and missing evidence, updates to the Discover “What’s New” list and the YouTubeMe informational page external link/copy cannot be fully verified, nor can we confirm there are zero remaining “YouTubeMe.co” references across the frontend. Additionally, two non-requested metadata/state files were modified.",
